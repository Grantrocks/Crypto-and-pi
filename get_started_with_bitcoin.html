									<h2>What is Bitcoin?</h2>
									<p>Bitcoin is a crypto-currency that is not controlled by the government. It is very easy to use and control and you dont need any kind of approval to use it. But it is very expensive. 1 bitcoin is right now worth what the graph below says. Second thing is it is very risky as you can put millions into it and then lose it all. But if you are using it to save money than it is useful that way.</p>

									<h2>Get A Wallet</h2>
									<p>When you get Bitcoin you are going to need to store it somewhere. That is where a bitcoin wallet comes in. There are three kinds of wallets and I highly recommend the first 2. 
									The first kind of wallet is a web wallet. This is my best choice for a wallet because you dont need to install anything on your computer. The second is a software wallet. I dont choose this because if you accidentally delete it all of your money is gone. And the third kind of wallet is a hardware wallet. I dont use this because you cant use this for any miners and you can easily lose it. So the wallet that I use is <a href="https://guarda.co/app">Guarda.</a> Its completely free and it has every kind of wallet. You can also but ecxchange, convert, recive, and send bitcoin.</p>
									<hr class="major" />
									
									
									
									<h2>Miners</h2>
									<img src="images/miners.jpeg" alt="Mining Bitcoin" />
									<p>You need bitcoin for your wallet right? And you want it to be free. Well I know the right tools. Probably the top best and fastest bitcoin miners online are these five Speed Miner, Real Mining, Freemining.co, FreeBitcoinMining.com, and Moon Bit.</p>
									<ul>
										<li><h2>Real Mining</h2>
											<p>This is the best bitcoin miner. It is the fastest miner and its the most reliable. The website is completely secure. Its super simple to sign up for, all you need is your wallets bitcoin address. It immediatly starts to mine and it mines really fast. It also contains the same chart of the cost of Bitcoin above. It also has a referral system where if you refer someone you get a bitcoin mining speed up. I highly recommend this Bitcoin miner. And I am currently making $100+ every week and a half.</p>
										</li>
										<li><h2>Speed Miner</h2>
										<p>This is the second best bitcoin miner because it is definatly not as fast as Real Mining. This is also a reliable bitcoin miner. It again is easy to sign up for, via Bitcoin address. It starts mining imediatley and it offers a referral system for boosts.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<h2>FreeMining</h2>
											<p>This is the third best. I made it third because although it mines faster than the others, its a tad bit weird. My first look made me say "NO, WAY AM I USING THIS!" But I looked farther into it and it turns out that it is actually pretty good. You sign up via Bitcoin address and 6 digit pin. I am pretty sure that they offer a refferal system for boosts.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
										<h2>Free Bitcoin Mining</h2>
										<p>This is going to be fourth. This is just about the same as Free Mining. But the site seems to be not as updated. It mines almost the same as Real Mining but it does have a bit less of features. You can sign up via Bitcoin Address</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<h2>Moon Cloud</h2>
											<p>This is the last choice for me. I dont really like it too much because I have other bitcoin miners, but I do reccomend this as it is very fast and it is easy to use. Sign up via Bitcoin address</p>
										</li>
										<li>Just to put this out there, do NOT us miningcompany.ltd. It is way overpriced for the bitcoin miners to go as fast as realmining which is free and the free version of this is SUPER slow.</li>
