									<h2>What is Bitcoin?</h2>
									<p>Bitcoin is a crypto-currency that is not controlled by the government. It is very easy to use and control and you dont need any kind of approval to use it. But it is very expensive. 1 bitcoin is right now worth what the graph below says. Second thing is it is very risky as you can put millions into it and then lose it all. But if you are using it to save money than it is useful that way.</p>

									<h2>Get A Wallet</h2>
									<p>When you get Bitcoin you are going to need to store it somewhere. That is where a bitcoin wallet comes in. There are three kinds of wallets and I highly recommend the first 2. 
									The first kind of wallet is a web wallet. This is my best choice for a wallet because you dont need to install anything on your computer. The second is a software wallet. I dont choose this because if you accidentally delete it all of your money is gone. And the third kind of wallet is a hardware wallet. I dont use this because you cant use this for any miners and you can easily lose it. So the wallet that I use is <a href="https://guarda.co/app">Guarda.</a> Its completely free and it has every kind of wallet. You can also but ecxchange, convert, recive, and send bitcoin.</p>
									<hr class="major" />

									
									
									<h2>Miners</h2>
									<img src="images/miners.jpeg" alt="Mining Bitcoin" />
									<p>You need bitcoin for your wallet right? And you want it to be free. Well I know the right tools. Probably the top best and fastest bitcoin miners online are these five Speed Miner, Real Mining, Freemining.co, FreeBitcoinMining.com, and Moon Bit.</p>
									<ul>
										<li><h2>Real Mining</h2>
											<p>This is the best bitcoin miner. It is the fastest miner and its the most reliable. The website is completely secure. Its super simple to sign up for, all you need is your wallets bitcoin address. It immediatly starts to mine and it mines really fast. It also contains the same chart of the cost of Bitcoin above. It also has a referral system where if you refer someone you get a bitcoin mining speed up. I highly recommend this Bitcoin miner. And I am currently making $100+ every week and a half.</p>
										</li>
										<li><h2>Speed Miner</h2>
										<p>This is the second best bitcoin miner because it is definatly not as fast as Real Mining. This is also a reliable bitcoin miner. It again is easy to sign up for, via Bitcoin address. It starts mining imediatley and it offers a referral system for boosts.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<h2>FreeMining</h2>
											<p>This is the third best. I made it third because although it mines faster than the others, its a tad bit weird. My first look made me say "NO, WAY AM I USING THIS!" But I looked farther into it and it turns out that it is actually pretty good. You sign up via Bitcoin address and 6 digit pin. I am pretty sure that they offer a refferal system for boosts.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
										<h2>Free Bitcoin Mining</h2>
										<p>This is going to be fourth. This is just about the same as Free Mining. But the site seems to be not as updated. It mines almost the same as Real Mining but it does have a bit less of features. You can sign up via Bitcoin Address</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<h2>Moon Cloud</h2>
											<p>This is the last choice for me. I dont really like it too much because I have other bitcoin miners, but I do reccomend this as it is very fast and it is easy to use. Sign up via Bitcoin address</p>
										</li>
										<li>DISCLAIMER: non of these miners are free you will always have to pay a fee of 10-40 dollars</li>
									</ul>
									<hr class="major" />
									<h2>Get Some Bitcoin For Free</h2>
									<p>You are not goint to get bitcoin for free without doing any kind of work. Trust me. I was once obsessed with getting free bitcoin but every site never worked. And I used every single site. So I am going to teach you how to get bitcoin free without paying a cent.</p>
									<h3>Earn For Work</h3>
									<p>Yes there are freelancing sites that pay through bitcoin. They dont have to be a crypto freelancing site but usually if it pays through bitcoin, most of the jobs have to do with bitcoin.</p>
									<h4>Bitcoin Freelancing Sites</h4>
									<ol>
										<li><a href="https://cryptogrind.com" target="blank"><strong>CryptoGrind.com</strong></a></li>
										<p>This is one of the most popular sites to get some freelancing work done and get paid in bitcoin. It has many users and it has a reveiw system so that way if you want to be reveiwed and get more work than this is the site for you. CryptoGrind also offers a hiring system so if you beed work done and you want to pay in bitcoin than you can do that too.</p>
										<li><a href="https://cryptoperhour.com" target="blank"><strong>Crypto Per Hour</strong></a></li>
										<p>Now Crypto Per Hour is not the best site in the world its got its flaws and one of the major flaws are the payments these people allow are very low. I have completed 24 jobs and I have made only about 15 cents. It is a very slow to earn site and it is not the best site to earn from. Also the majority of the jobs avaiable are subscribing to YouTube channels and following social media accounts and the people dont usually respond back and you dont get paid money. So if I were you I would probably just stick to CryptoGrind</p>
										
									</ol>
									<h4>Doing Offers</h4>
									<p>Now this is probably one of the easiest but not the safest ways to get bitcoin. A lot of the offers that you need to complete might steal your information or stuff like that or call you non-stop or maybe even send you emails over and over again. But I have found a pair of sites that dont do that to you. These sites also have several ways to earn and they have several bonuses.</p>
									<ol>
										<li><a href="https://bucksify.com/?ref=g555305" target="blank"><strong>Faucet Crypto</strong></a></li>
										<p>Bucksify is a safe, easy, fast, and high earning offer and faucet site. Bucksify offers a referral system, a level system that gives bonuses for every level, a daily bonus, a referral system and a chat. The offers are super easy to complete and they usually are just small surveys or click on a site link or watching videos. The level system which I am currently at level 48 and it took me 4 hours of work gives me a bonus of 34 percent. So that means I get a lot more money for every offer I complete. It has a minimum withdrawl of $5.00 for bitcoin and it pays within 2 days or less. They also have several other
											crypto-currencys to withdraw too and giftcards. I highly recommend this site and you should use it too.</p>
										<li><a href="https://faucetcrypto.com" target="blank"><strong>Faucet Crypto</strong></a></li>
											<p>Facuet Crytpo is mainly a faucet site but it also offers many other ways to earn. Probably one of my favorite ways to earn on this site are the PTC ads and the shortlinks. Those are the 2 highest pays ways to earn on this site. Facuet Crypto also offers a level system to boost your earnings and a referral system. The offerwalls on this site are unlocked by reaching a certain level
												and they are also high paying. Each coin you earn here is equvelant to about 10 satoshi. THe minimum withdrawl for this site is 1000 and they charge a fee of 50 coins for transaction. One downside about this site though is that the favorite ways to withdraw require facuetpay and that is not avaiable in the U.S.A.</p>
										
										
										
										
										
									</ol>
									<h3>UPDATE</h3>
									<p>I now present to you the way to earn without paying a dime hundreds of dollars worth of bitcoin in a matter of hours without work.</p>
									<p>This method used to not work as the servers for this method were down for months but now they are up again. The reason they were down because there were so many things wrong with there site that they needed to fix and they did. And this method uses the site <a href="https://btcmining.best/cpuwin/bitcoin-mining/ref/487679" target="blank">BTC Mining Best</a>. This site also has other miners just go to<a href="https://btcmining.best" target="blank">Btcmining.best</a> and you will find all of their services.</p>
